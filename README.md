# Single-Cycle-CPU-Simulator

## How to use
- Convert instructions to binary
  - https://luplab.gitlab.io/rvcodecjs/
- Put instructions in file test.txt
- Run program

## Features
- Read instructions from file
- R-type, I-type, S-type, B-Type instructions
- Support for other types (yet to have their functions implemented)

## ToDo
- Pass file as parameter instead of having hardcoded "test.txt" file
- Implement some remaining R-Type, I-type and B-Type instructions
- Implement J and U-type instructions
- Write instructions in assembly and have program convert into binary

## Test
- Ignore this :3
